# multi-system-dim-box
A system for a user to choose a system of distance measurement and degree of resolution. So that a program's internally stored dimension (cm in this case) is converted to the user's chosen system and displayed in a data input box. The user can change the value via their chosen system. Which is then converted to the program's system and stored.
