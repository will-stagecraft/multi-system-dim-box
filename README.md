# multi-system-dim-box
A system for a user to choose a system of distance measurement and degree of resolution. 

A program's internally stored dimension (cm in this case) is converted to the user's chosen system and displayed in a data input box. 

The user can change the value via their chosen system. Which is then converted to the program's system and stored.

In addition the user can do basic mathmatical calculations inside the data input box.
